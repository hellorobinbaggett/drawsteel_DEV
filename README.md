- What is this? Where am I?

This is a custom ruleset that was made for the Fantasy Grounds VTT by Exxodis during the Draw Steel beta. 
It has now become an extensive collection of rules and mechanics for the published system. You NEED Fantasy Grounds
Unity to run this. It is an extension that lives inside your FGU files.
Special thanks to Koboldling, JT, DM Rebecca, GildedDragonborn, lil tummy, Renée Wojak, AboveAverageTurtle
I could not have done this without your help entering in hundreds of pages into the data modules.
Thank you MoonWizard for all of your help with making this a standalone ruleset. 
No "AI" (Large Language Models) :)

- I want to play Draw Steel! What are the steps to install?

1. Do you have fantasy grounds unity?
    this ruleset is compatible only with the fantasy grounds unity version
    - You can purchase it from the Steam app OR...
    - Download it directly: https://www.fantasygrounds.com/
2. Find your Fantasy Grounds Unity data folder
    - It sounds scary - but it isn't! You just need to open your File Explore and type
      'C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\SmiteWorks\Fantasy Grounds'
      You need to replace the Username with whatever name you have, and make sure the letter drive is accurate (the C:\ thing)
3. From the Fantasy Grounds folder, find the folder called "rulesets"
   Perfect! that's all you need to do for Fantasy Grounds. Keep that folder open (we are going to use it later)

4. Download all of the files of this repository.
     - It should place them in a .zip file in your downloads.
6. Find where it is downloaded and copy (Ctrl + C) the folder
7. Go to the folder from earlier "rulesets" and right click on a blank space, then select "Paste"

Congratulations! You now have this extension installed! Easy as that!

- How do I use this extension once I open up FGU?

When you are ready, you can create your own Draw Steel campaign. Run Fantasy Grounds Unity, then create a campaign.
Underneath "rulesets" you should see one labeled "Draw Steel". Use that one!
And now you're ready to....DRAW STEEL!
